# To-do-List
The project is a simple to-do list application built in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical interface. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as done, with tasks persistently saved to a file, providing a basic and user-friendly task management tool.  Tasks are visually differentiated, with completed tasks highlighted in lime green. On startup, the application loads tasks from a JSON file, promoting a seamless user experience.
